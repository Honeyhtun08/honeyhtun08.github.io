I am a senior undergraduate student, majoring in Physics with a focus on Astrophysics and a minor in Computer Science. Throughout my undergraduate years, I've worked on computational projects in Cosmological Simulations, High Energy Astrophysics, Planetary Physics. You can find more about my experience on the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) page and you can also access my [CV](/cv/) here.

I was born and raised in the beautiful [Mandalay, Myanmar (Burma)](https://www.hotelredcanal.com/2017/05/15/mandalay-seven-structure/) and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics at New York University, Abu Dhabi. In my free time, I love to paint.
