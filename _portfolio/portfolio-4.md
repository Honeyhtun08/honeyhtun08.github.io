## Overview


Understanding star formation mechanisms is crucial for comprehending how galaxies evolve. Stars formation occurs in Giant molecular gas clouds containing dense and cold enough gas that gravitational potential energy overcomes kinetic energy. These giant molecular clouds are extremely dense, with an average of 100 particles per cubic centimeter, reaching up to 106 particles per cubic centimeter. Simulating such high densities is challenging, and we aim to address this by employing the virial theorem to describe star formation criteria in numerical simulations (McKee and Zweibel, 1992, Krumholz and McKee, 2005).
