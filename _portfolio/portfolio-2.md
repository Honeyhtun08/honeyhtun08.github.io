## Overview

We report a follow up analysis on the possible existence of a Wolf-Rayet star embedded in the Kes 75 PWN followed by the Sepctral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling of the  high energy Gamma-ray emission of this region.
An additional secondary photon field was required to account for the GeV emission measured from a Gamma ray point source in the area. The translated stellar properties of the said photon field is comparable to that of Wolf-Rayet(WR) 
stars as established in literature. To identify the proposed WR star, we analyzed the source population within 1 arcmin of Kes 75 center using their Near Infrared Magnitude values using UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey. Subsequent
filtering criteria based on distance, extinction, expected magnitudes, and red giants contamination were applied to further reduce the number of final WR candidates.
We ended up with one Carbon rich (WC) and three Nitrogen rich (WN) stars surviving all the criteria. To assess their significance, a false probability test was also carried out assuming 170 random locations 
within the 1 degree radius of Kes 75 as region of interest. We found approximately 88% and 77% of these locations 
displayed fewer WC and WN final candidates than the Kes 75 region. However, the WN candidates were concluded to be 
statistically insignificant as they returned total final candidates more than the number of random locations. When 
focusing on carbon-rich stars, the presence of at least one source was observed in only about 12% of the instances 
and only 10% was within the distance of our final candidate from Kes 75 region.
